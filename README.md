### How to work with Github Issues
- Review the issues in "To Do" Column
- Assign one of them to you
- Move it "In Progress"
- in corresponding channel, which issue you have taken
- start working on it
- share early and often the status(work if possible in small chunks) in the channel and also update the GITHub issue
- when issue is completed, update/attach to the issue  the files/instructions/images/wireframes
- All submissions to GIT repo to be done with Pull Request, put GITHub issue number as reference.


Notes:
all submissions to be done via Pull Requests
use corresponding channel to ask questions and share work
work as a team to collaborate
at this stage it is ok for multiple resources to be allocated to the same issue, just share status and collaborate


### GITHub Boards Descriptions(Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done)


-  Backlog we have tasks that should not be worked on at the moment - These issues are tagged with P2 (which means 'Medium Priority')

- in To Do we have the tasks that should be worked on next but DON'T have anybody assigned (so if you have cycles between now at tomorrow, please let us know, or assign it to you) - These issues are tagged with P1 (which mean High Priority)

- in the In Progress are issues that somebody is ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW (this last bit is important since you are clocking for the day, and have not move that issue the To Review status, then move it back to the To Do Status (these issues also have the P1 label)

- in the To Review status we have the issues that need review from a member of the Glasswall team (important: only members of the Glasswall team should move issues from the To Review status to the Done status)
